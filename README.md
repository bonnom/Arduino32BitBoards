# Arduino32bitBoards device adapter
This git contains a new Micro-Manager device adapter for Arduino 32-bits boards.
This device adapter contains extra futures compared to the regular arduino device adapter.

Currently the Teensy 3.5 is the recommended board to be used with this device adapter, bur there is also firmware available for the teensy 3.2, ESP32 and feather M4.

Differences compared to regular Arduino Device Adapter:
* Two extra output channels to a total of 8
* Added Pulse-width modulation (PWM) control
* Unified DAC and PWM
* Unified digital-out channels and DAC/PWM channels, this allows DAC/PWM blanking on all 8 channels
* Changed unit of DAC/ PWM from "Volt" to "Power %" and the default scale to 0-100
* In the Firmware: Channels 1 - 2 are by default DAC channels, channels 3-8 are by default PWM

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Arduino 32 Bit-boards in general
### Advantages
* Much faster, because of higher clock speed and more is done per clockcycle.
* Baudrate increased to 500 000, nearly 9 times the transferspeed between Arduino and Micro-Manager (there are some exceptions). This can be even increased to 2 000 000
* Most 32-bit Arduinos have a buildin DAC (max 3.3V output)
* Higher PWM frequencies and PWM bitresolutions
* More flexibility with pins used

### Disadvantges
* Most are not 5V tolerant, this means you'll need voltage level converter when using the triggerpin. It is recommended to use Teensy 3.5 since this board does have 5V tolerant inputs. When using a not 5V tolerant board it is recommended to use a voltage level converter like this one [link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/757) or this one [link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009)
* Library support might not always be great

## Installation
This page is an overview of the installation links for Arduino and the respective boards

### Arduino (Required)
Arduino offers two solutions, an online editor and a local Integrated development environment (IDE) program.
It is recommended to use the local IDE software.
The page for the software can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

### Adafruit
Adafruit makes two programming environments to use on their 32-bit boards. One is circuit python and Arduino. Circuitpython currently doesn't work with micro-manager.
Guide for installing the Adafruit Feather M4 board can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m4-express-atsamd51/setup)

### Esp32
ESP32 arduino core installation link can be found [here](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md)
Also when using an windows version older than Windows 10 driver installation might be needed. There are two types of usb to serial chips used with each their own driver. If you are not sure what IC is used just install both drivers.

These two are the most common type of drivers:
* [SiLabs cp210x](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
* [CH340] (https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/4/4/CH341SER.EXE)

### Teensy boards
Teensy requires its own installation software that can be downloaded [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

## Drivers
On windows 10 the Arduino-compatible board drivers are automatically installed, but this is not the case for windows 7 and below.

There are two ways to install the Arduino-compatible board drivers, the first is to install the Arduino IDE and than the installing the board under boards-manager. The second way is to install the standalone driver packages. These are listed below.

### Adafruit Serial Drivers:
* Most general driver package
* Includes drivers for FTDI
* Includes SiLabs CP210x drivers

### CH340G:
* Used on a lot of Arduino-compatible boards from China
